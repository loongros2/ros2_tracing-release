Plan for a first public post/announcement.
This week.

Simple example:
* Jupyter notebook to plot:
    * subscription callback duration
    * CPU cycles/callback
* and resolve/demangle symbols
* Include all files/scripts needed to get the result, but keep it simple
* To be hosted somewhere
* With some documentation/guide on how to try it out

Post:
* Mention that we're working on this
* Talk about goals in general
* Target = next release
* Show off example
* Invite people to ask questions/discuss

Architecture considerations (right now but also later):
* Try to use a dataframe as a ROS model abstraction, instead of first going through a layer with python data structures
*
